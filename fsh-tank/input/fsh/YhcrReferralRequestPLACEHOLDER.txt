There is no ReferralRequest in FHIR R4!

However there is a ServiceRequest that is 90% similar, 
and the CareConnect ReferralRequest is therefore avaiable here, built over that

1) Consider if profiling ReferralRequest is a good idea? (Or should we go straight to the new R4 ServiceRequest?)

2) If proceeding, then need to carefully compare STU3 ReferralRequest and R4 ServiceRequest and understand the differences
   - This is good to do anyway, to consider future migration path
   - Some fields have been renamed - which is similar to other R4 renames, and easily dealt with in the "convert-STU3" script
   - A few changes are more significant. In most cases there is a "similar"field in R4 which could be profiled and renamed.
     However it is possible that some profiling statements might need to be added directly in code in "convert-STU3" script
